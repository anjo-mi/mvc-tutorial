## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MVC Formatting

This project provides a walk-through, going from a single page server, to a well-organized MVC architecture, outlining each step of the process with details and screenshots. It makes sure to follow industry best practices. The site works across platforms, making use of responsive web design.

## Optimizations

Animations are provided for smooth transitions to keep users aware of what step is being accessed at each point. Linked Lists and Arrays are put into use to aid in proper navigation, both forwards and backwards. Double tap functionality is provided for touch screens, and Arrow Clicks for keyboards to avoid needlessly tracking the Next and Prev buttons.

## Lessons Learned:

- When struggling to implement a new feature, Google will ALWAYS help eventually.

- Touch navigation is extremely useful when button placement is not consistent.

- Providing some humor allows for not only a better user experience, but also a better dev experience.
